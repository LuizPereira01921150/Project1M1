Current in: Milestone 2:Status Update.

to see pages go to "pages" folder.

purpose: show people a bit about who I am and what projects I have done. Also, I want to provide users a way to contact me if they wish to do so.

Structure:
3 pages: 
  About -> page with information about who I am, where I'm from, what my skills are and my timeline.
  Projects -> a page with all the projects i've done.
  contact -> a page with my resume and ways to contact me.
